								<h1>Hey There! I'm <strong>Suchitra!</strong></h1>
							</header>
							<p>And this is my <strong>portfolio website</strong>, a fully responsive, handcrafted HTML5 site.</p> 
							<p>A little bit about my journey,<br><br>
Ever since I was a child, I have always dreamt of becoming a pediatric surgeon, however, I fell in love with programming instantly when it was introduced to me in high school. During COVID-19 pandemic I witnessed the challenges faced by underprivileged individuals without access to vital health information.  Through collecting real-time data and connecting people in need of medical supplies to providers, I saw the impact that timely and accurate information can have on saving lives. 
<p>My academic coursework in <strong>computer science</strong>, including data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, have shown me the power of computation in leveraging data to improve healthcare outcomes all of which led me to pursue my <strong>Master’s in Health Informatics</strong>. Through the course of my career, I aspire to lead research on developing integrated Electronic Health Record Systems capable of unifying diverse healthcare data, and building models that enable hyper-individualized data-driven disease prediction, discovery and treatment.</p> 
<p>Healthcare is complicated. It is rapidly changing with the advent of new therapies, new data, and new opportunities. It is a complex environment and getting it right is a challenge. This is an endeavor I am committed to.</p>

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/such-chitrah/Humanitarian-Aid-Clustering-Analysis/blob/main/humanitarian-aid-pca-clustering.ipynb" target="_blank">Humanitarian Aid to Underdeveloped Countries</a></h3>
								<p>The project focused on providing humanitarian aid to underdeveloped countries based on a data-driven approach. Specifically, the project used principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques to identify countries in dire need of aid based on various factors such as child mortality, income, and other socio-economic indicators. The project utilized data from the Humanitarian Aid dataset on Kaggle and employed unsupervised learning techniques to analyze and cluster the data. By using PCA, the project was able to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify the most important factors that contribute to a country's development. Clustering techniques were then used to group countries based on their similarities and identify those that require the most aid.</p>

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/such-chitrah/Activity-Tweeting-Classification/blob/main/Bert-Activity-Tweeting.ipynb" target="_blank">Activity Tweeting Classification</a></h3>
								<p>The project aims to use BERT, a powerful pre-trained deep learning language model, to analyze and generate activity tweets. Activity tweeting refers to tweets that contain information about physical activities, such as sports, fitness, or outdoor activities.BERT is a state-of-the-art language model that has been shown to be highly effective in a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including language understanding and text generation. In this project, BERT is fine-tuned on a dataset of activity-related tweets to learn the nuances and context of language related to physical activities..</p>

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/such-chitrah/Readmission-of-Diabetic-Patients/blob/main/readmit-patients-diabetic-data.ipynb" target="_blank" >Diabetes Patient's Hospital Readmission Prediction</a></h3>
								<p>The project is aimed at developing a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a diabetic patient being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. The project uses a dataset containing information on patients' demographics, medical history, medications, and hospitalization details.

The project uses basic machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines to build the predictive model. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, and the model is trained on the training set using the selected algorithm.</p>

								<p>The project aims to investigate the association between exposure to secondhand smoke and the risk of developing heart disease using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Specifically, the project will analyze data on levels of homocysteine and cotinine in the blood, which are biomarkers of cardiovascular risk and exposure to tobacco smoke, respectively.The project will use statistical methods, such as regression analysis and propensity score matching, to control for potential confounding factors, such as age, sex, race, and lifestyle factors. The analysis will examine the association between passive smoking exposure, as measured by cotinine levels, and homocysteine levels, as well as the association between passive smoking exposure and the risk of developing heart disease.</p>
